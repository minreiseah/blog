### To my past self,

You asked God for strength, and God gave you _CS2101: Effective Communication for Computing Professionals_.

As you stand on the precipice of this academic endeavour, let me guide you through some of your misconceptions, concerning the nature of collaboration and control.

You'll find that CS2101 is where you trade your director's hat for an actor's script. It's not just okay to let go, it's _liberating_. The stage is more exhilarating when you share it with others.

## Misconception #1: Control Guarantees Perfection in Presentations

You faced OP1 with a director's mindset, intending to script your group's every move. The approach quickly revealed its flaws.

One vivid instance encapsulated this challenge: during a rehearsal, a debate erupted over defining emotional intelligence as its [academic notion](https://hbr.org/2017/02/emotional-intelligence-has-12-elements-which-do-you-need-to-work-on)—balancing internal self-awareness with external social skills—or its common interpretation as mere social prowess. You sided with the former.

The moment of clarity came when your teammate illustrated how blending both interpretations could enhance your delivery of emotional intelligence to a general audience. By relating [statistics on emotional intelligence in the workplace](https://www.talentsmarteq.com/how-do-you-stack-up-eq-trends-by-industry/) to our student lives, the gap was thus bridged.

Reluctantly, you began to loosen your grip on the reins. This shift was transformative in faciliating a space where ideas could germinate and flourish.

> This new role required humility and an openness to the unexpected—**qualities you hadn't prioritised before.**

## Misconception #2: Autonomy Breeds Inefficiency

While leading the product pitch, you feared that stepping back would lead to a lack of direction and a chaotic end product.

When your teammate suggested featuring his [COVID-19 Resilience Medal](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-resilience-medal-award-moh-response-open-letter-4004286), you initially dismissed the prop as overly ambitious. But, reflecting upon your OP1 experience, you begrudgingly decided to support his approach.

He led the effort and effectively wove the medal into his feature on contact tracing. This created one of the most captivating parts of the pitch, where we received thunderous applause for his sharp wit.

> True skill lies in knowing when to lead and when to let go, allowing the team's collective capabilities to steer the project towards success.

## Moving Forward

If you weren't steering the ship, it would inevitably sink. CS2101 was the iceberg that showed you not all ships need a solitary captian.

On this ship, every member's voice had the potential to script the next great scene; you just had to listen.

So, as you embark on this journey, step down from the director's chair and join the ensemble. It’s in this shared space that you’ll discover the strength that comes not from directing every detail, but from harmonising the many voices, including your own, into a symphony of **_effective communication_**.
